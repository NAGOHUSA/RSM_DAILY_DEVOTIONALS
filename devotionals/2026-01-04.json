Yet, our Good Shepherd is always with us, watching over us and caring for our souls. Jesus reminds us here that He has the power to call on divine help, if needed. But He doesn't because He is our Shepherd, not a hireling who flees when danger comes. He laid down His life for us, and in His absence, His promise to us remains: \"I am with you always, to the end of the age\" (Matthew 28:20). This promises us peace, comfort, and guidance. When we feel lost or frightened, we must remember that our Shepherd's care is always near, and He will never forsake us.\n\n## Prayer\n\nWe thank you, heavenly Father, for sending us a Shepherd who cares for us so deeply. May we trust in your promise to be always with us, and may we find peace and comfort in your loving care.\n\n## One-Line Application\n\nWe can trust our Shepherd's care in times of uncertainty.",
