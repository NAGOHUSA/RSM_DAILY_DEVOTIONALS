But God's Word reminds us that our struggles can be a catalyst for spiritual growth. When we persevere through difficulties, we develop character, and that character gives us hope for a brighter future. This isn't to say that suffering is enjoyable, but it can be a means of deepening our faith and trust in God. By embracing our sufferings and persevering through them, we can experience the transformative power of God's presence in our lives. This isn't just a theoretical concept; it's a lived reality for those who have walked through the fires of adversity and emerged stronger on the other side.\n\n## Prayer\n\nWe thank you, God, for the opportunity to persevere in our struggles and to grow in our faith. Help us to see our sufferings as a means of building character and hope, rather than as obstacles to be avoided. Grant us the strength to endure and to trust in your presence in our lives.\n\n## One-Line Application\n\nMay we learn to find hope in our struggles, trusting God's transforming power.",
