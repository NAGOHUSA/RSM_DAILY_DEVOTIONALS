As followers of Christ, we're called to care for one another, just as a shepherd tends to their flock. This requires a willingness to serve, not out of obligation, but out of love and a genuine desire to help. It's not about seeking personal gain or recognition, but about being present for one another and providing a supportive environment where everyone can grow.\n\nIn a world that often values independence and self-reliance, it's easy to forget the importance of interdependence and mutual care. However, as we strive to become more like Christ, we're reminded that our strength comes from our weaknesses, and our unity comes from our diversity. By embracing this mindset, we can create a safe space where people feel seen, heard, and valued.\n\n## Prayer\n\nWe pray for the courage to serve one another with a willing heart, putting the needs of others before our own. May we be a source of comfort, encouragement, and strength to those around us.\n\n## One-Line Application\n\nWe must serve others with a willing heart, putting their needs above our own.",
