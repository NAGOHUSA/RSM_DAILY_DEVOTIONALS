We may question why He allows trials and difficulties to enter our lives. But James reminds us that these trials are not obstacles to be feared, but rather opportunities for growth and refinement. When we face challenges, we have a choice to make: we can become bitter or better. We can let our experiences shape us into people who are more like the world, or we can let them shape us into people who are more like Christ. The testing of our faith produces perseverance, and perseverance is the hallmark of a life that is truly grounded in God.\n\n## Prayer\n\nWe pray for the strength to face trials with joy, knowing that they produce perseverance in our faith. May we trust in Your sovereignty, Lord, and may our hearts be fixed on You.\n\n## One-Line Application\n\nWe can choose to view trials as opportunities for growth and refinement.",
